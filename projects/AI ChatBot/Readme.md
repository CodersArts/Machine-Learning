# AI ChatBot 

This AI ChatBot project is a implementation of a conversational agent that utilizes natural language processing and machine learning techniques to interact with users in a human-like manner.

The chatbot is built using popular python libraries like NLTK, Tensorflow and Keras for natural language processing and machine learning. It is designed to be able to understand and respond to user inputs in a variety of ways.

This project can be used in many areas such as customer service, personal assistance, and more. It can be trained on a specific task or industry-specific language to improve its performance in that area.

This repository contains a Python script for data preprocessing tasks using scikit-learn library. The script performs the following tasks:

# Handling Missing Values
The script reads in a dataset with missing values and handles the missing values using SimpleImputer from scikit-learn library.

# Handling Categorical Values
The script reads in a dataset with categorical features and handles the categorical features using OrdinalEncoder and OneHotEncoder from scikit-learn library.

# Discretization
The script reads in a dataset and performs binning or discretization using KBinsDiscretizer from scikit-learn library.

# Binarization
The script reads in a dataset and performs binarization using Binarizer from scikit-learn library.

# Scaling
The script reads in a dataset and performs different scaling techniques including StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, MaxAbsScaler and RobustScaler from scikit-learn library.

# Normalization
The script reads in a dataset and performs different normalization techniques including max-norm and l1-norm using normalize from scikit-learn library.

# Requirements
The script requires the following packages to be installed:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn

Thus preventing Heart attack risk has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the risk of Heart attak, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models were trained and and predictions are made with different algorithms Random Forest,SVM,Logistic Regression. This is the jupyter notebook code and dataset I've used for my Kaggle kernel 'Binary Classification with Sklearn

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart attack risk yes or not 

Machine Learning algorithms used:

* Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)  
* Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn) 
* KNN
* Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
